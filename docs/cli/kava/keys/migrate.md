## kava keys migrate

Migrate keys from the legacy (db-based) Keybase

### Synopsis

Migrate key information from the legacy (db-based) Keybase to the new keyring-based Keyring.
The legacy Keybase used to persist keys in a LevelDB database stored in a 'keys' sub-directory of
the old client application's home directory, e.g. $HOME/.gaiacli/keys/.
For each key material entry, the command will prompt if the key should be skipped or not. If the key
is not to be skipped, the passphrase must be entered. The key will only be migrated if the passphrase
is correct. Otherwise, the command will exit and migration must be repeated.

It is recommended to run in 'dry-run' mode first to verify all key migration material.


```
kava keys migrate <old_home_dir> [flags]

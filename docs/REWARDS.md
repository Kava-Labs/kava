# Become a Founding Member of Kava

> ### Validate & Earn Tokens

Every project begins with those brave few who have vision and grit. Fortune favors the bold, and the Kava community honors validators that participate in testnets and the mainnet launch with a badge commemorating their early validator services and entitling them to Kava tokens.
